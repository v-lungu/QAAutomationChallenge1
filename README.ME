In order to run, first confirm that both node and npm are installed. In the terminal type "node -v" and confirm node is installed. If it is not, then download online before running Cypress.

Confirm Cypress is installed with the "npm cypress -v" command. If it is not installed, use the "npm cypress install" command.

Open Cypress using the "npx cypress open" command. Tests can be run from this window.

To manually open and view script code in VScode, look inside the cypress>integration folder.
